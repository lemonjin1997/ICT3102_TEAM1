In order to get the location of the android mobile phone,
the calculation and determining the location of the mobile phone can done on flask server or mobile phone.
I will suggest it to be on the flask server. (it will not be in the current version)
Reasons for that suggest, increase flexibility for moving beacons and security reasons...
but if you want it to be simple just have phone do the it.
The mobile phone will just be sending location or the beacons that is can detect in a list with signal strength or distance.

The requirement is a bit weird. Why will you want to maintain a list of a location. 
If that is for audit, it is ok. but sending it over to another server?
